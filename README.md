# pagdan.github.io

Personal portfolio site for Robert Pagdanganan. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because sometimes less is more.

## What's Inside

- **Resume** — Education and work history
- **Portfolio** — Design work and case studies
- **Keyboards** — Custom mechanical keyboard builds (yes, it's a hobby)
- **Coffee Blog** — Tasting notes and brewing experiments
- **Contact** — Ways to reach me

## Tech Stack

Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No framework bloat, no build process, no npm install that takes five minutes. Just open the file and it works.

Uses [marked.js](https://marked.js.org/) for rendering blog content from markdown.

## Running Locally

Clone it, open `index.html` in a browser. That's it.

Feel free to look around, but this is my personal site, so please don't just copy-paste it wholesale. Build your own thing.

Built with a mechanical keyboard and probably too much coffee.
